# Addition Game
## Introduction
This assignment deals with how to create a four round addition game that increases in difficulty with every correct answer and decreases with incorrect answers. 
## Outline
``` java
/* Generate a random numbers 
* Prompt the user to add them together
* If correct add points and increase the difficulty
* When incorrect do not add points and decrease difficulty
* After four rounds display score
*/
```

## Code

		int number2 = (int)(Math.random() * hardness);
		int correctAnswer = number1 + number2;
		 		
		//  Ask the user to add these two numbers together
				
		System.out.println("What integer is " + number1 + " + " + number2 + "?");
		System.out.println("Please enter integers only.");
		
		 // Read in their response

## Summary
This assignment was to create an addition game that progressively got more difficult with each correct answer.
While originally I didnâ€™t get all of the code right but I used the code posted by Dr. Evert on git hub to complete it.
This code works by using if else statements to give the player the proper difficulty based on their performance and after 
four rounds it displays the score achieved. This assignment helped me further my knowledge with if and else statements and 
wonder what other ways there are to do this simpler.
